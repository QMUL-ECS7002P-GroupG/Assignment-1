This paper presents the outcome of Group G of the microRTS group project. The microRTS is a full-observed
real-time strategy game which is build on grid map within different scale and condition. The aim of our
group work is to construct a battle bot with specific strategy which can control the units on the map
automatically, based on the current state of the game, make the real-time decision and command and assign
the action to the units to beat the opponent on the map finally. This report will introduce the background
knowledge of the game, interpret the technical details of the bot we created and analyse the testing result
respectively.
