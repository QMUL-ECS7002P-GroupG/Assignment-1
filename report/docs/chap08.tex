\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

\subsection*{About the Strategy}

According to the tests we made and literature works we did, we found that ‘worker’ unit
and ‘light’ unit are very useful and flexible in those four kinds of maps since they are
cheaper and faster than others. Especially in some small maps, a strategy using WorkerRush
still holds a very high win rate, so we decide to explore more about strategies using workers
to rush, also applying it to more complex maps.

Also, we found that in the last type of map mentioned in Section \ref{section:analysis},
when normal units cannot be reachable to each team side, the ‘Ranged Attack’ units can
be very useful and efficient, we are also going to explore more about the strategies of
using ‘Ranged Attack’ units.

\subsection*{About the $\mu$RTS}

There are still some small bugs of this game when running different strategies. For example,
when using the smallest map, resources are very close to our base, only one grid unit distance,
so things will happen that when many workers are harvesting the resources at the same time,
will might be stuck by others (sometimes, not usually), so maybe this game is not that mature
to cope with all kinds of strategies, so our group want to find a way to fix it and make it better.
